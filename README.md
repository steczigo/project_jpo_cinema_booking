# project_jpo_cinema_booking
Just a cinema ticket booking project for college Object Oriented Programming 

=== Remember to extract files from string.zip (which is part of BOOST library) to the directory where you put the whole project (../project_dir/string/...) and to add precompiled boost headers to the project, otherwise it won't compile ===

09.01.2019 final (?) version 
- no GUI ( :< no time )
- many features missing like a few basic error handlers ( again, no time )
- works fine
